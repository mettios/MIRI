To address the issues in BadPotTwo, the fillpot and getservings methods in the Pot class are synchronized. Upon reviewing the output, the problems with negative servings and other misbehaviors are resolved.
The Banket model is more efficient in terms of resource management. When the resource is unavailable, consumers automatically wait until they are notified, or the system signals for a refill once the resource is fully depleted. This ensures coordinated access without unnecessary retries.
In contrast, the BanketNoWait model requires each consumer to independently check if the resource is available. If unavailable, the consumer simply retries later (“goes for a walk”), which may lead to less efficient resource utilization.
The choice between these models depends on the specific requirements and nature of the tasks and resources involved. Both approaches can be viable under different circumstances, but if I were to recommend one, I would pick Banket.
